n this publication a parton shower model based on Catani-Seymour dipole subtraction kernels has been presented, which was proposed for the first time in [1,2]. Inthe present implementation, the original proposal is extended to cover also initial-state splittings, finite parton masses,and QCD radiation off SUSY particles.Choices concerning the evolution parameter of the parton shower and the various scales entering running coupling constants, PDFs, etc. have been detailed, fixing the full algorithm.The kinematics of massive splittings has been presented in some detail, and the corresponding massless limits have been discussed. By direct comparison with some benchmark processes,
at first order in $ \alpha_s $, the differences of the parton shower approximation with respect to exact results have been worked out.  It has been shown that indeed the parton shower algorithm presented here reproduces the soft and collinear limits of the exact matrix elements and that differences between both results are non-singular terms only. Some first results with this new parton shower formulation have been presented and show very encouraging agreement with other models and with experimental data.
