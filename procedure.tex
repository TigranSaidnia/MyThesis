Before the procedure is explained it should be mentioned that the steps are gradually explained in more detail in the next chapter. This only provides a rough overview and can be used as a reference for the computing.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider a possible splitting. For this one has to ensure that all possible meaningful diagrams have been considered.
All $ |M_i|^2 $ diagrams need to be labelled independently.  To determine the matrix elements, Feynmann rules will be used which is derived in detail in the appendix section \ref{Feynman}. Before the kinematics is used, the obtained matrix element should be simplified by matrix algebra, otherwise the calculation becomes clearly more complicated.
\\
\item Each diagram consists of two emitters and a spectator.
The emitter parent with the momentum $ q_i+q $ in the old kinematic splits into a daughter-parton with $ q_i $ and an another emitter $ q $. One should select the spectator $ q_j $ skilfully so that the diagrams are meaningful and calculable in the case of the interference terms, otherwise the final results have to be changed. Thus a structure is achieved and the diagrams can be replaced from $ M_1, {M_1}^{\dagger}$,  $ M_2 $ and ${M_2}^{\dagger}$ step by step and even their amplitudes can be used for the interference terms. 
\\
\item Before starting to calculate, based on the contracted indices the expected result should be predicted. This is relatively helpful since it can be quickly seen from the square matrix element which terms are relevant for the splitting functions.
\\
\item It is recommended to use the concepts from the previous section \ref{recepie}. Basically, there are four common scalar products from the denominators listed here:

\begin{itemize}
\item $ (q \cdot q_i)(q \cdot q_i) $
\item $ (q \cdot q_j)(k_1 \cdot q_j) $
\item $ (q \cdot q_i)(q \cdot q_j) $
\item $ (q \cdot q_i)(q_i \cdot q_i) $
\end{itemize}

For the new parametrisation, the following substitution is used:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
&q_i \rightarrow q_i\\
&q \: \rightarrow k_1\\
&q_j \rightarrow q_k
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\\
\item Finally, after the addition of the contributing quadratic matrix elements, $y$ is set to zero to consider the final result in collinear limits. It is expected that this result will generate the Alterali-Parisi splitting functions \ref{Alterali-Parisi}. This step is a valid control to determine if the calculation has been calculated correctly at least in the collinear region.
\\
\item In the case of indistinguishable particles in relation to the interference term, the momentum of the particles for the same diagram must be exchanged once.
\end{enumerate}
